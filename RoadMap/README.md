Here's the list of milestones for __Slack Music Buddy :__

## _Excpected and realistic :straight_ruler:_
---
- [x] You can search for spotify songs directly from slack 
- [x] You can search for youtube videos directly from slack
- [x] The bot displays its own commands
- [x] The project passes every test from Rspec
## _Excpected and realistic (FROM THE CAPSTONE REVIEW) :straight_ruler:_
- [x] This project has no pull request, hence hard to review the code changes or access linter errors. 
- [x] The 'dotenv' gem should be placed in the Gemfile as well. 
- [x] The commit messages are not descriptive, this makes your repository look somewhat less professional. 
- [x] The README file does not properly explain how to use the repo. Like how to incorporate it with slack, how to test locally, etc. Also you should add something to install dependencies at the beginning.
### _Optional_
- [x] Improve on the single responsability principle
---
## _Harder but doable :pick:_
---
- [x] Bot is online, you don't need to run it locally
- [ ] You can rate the music by style, and get recommendations based on the styles
- [ ] The bot stores authorization tokens and only refreshes them when they exprire

## _A man can dream :eyeglasses:_
---
- [ ] Creates a bagde system for users who share music based on # of publications and likes by other users
